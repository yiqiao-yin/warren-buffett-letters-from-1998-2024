{"index": 1, "markdown": "# BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \n\n## To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\n\nBerkshire's gain in net worth during 2013 was $\\$ 34.2$ billion. That gain was after our deducting $\\$ 1.8$ billion of charges - meaningless economically, as I will explain later - that arose from our purchase of the minority interests in Marmon and Iscar. After those charges, the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by $18.2 \\%$. Over the last 49 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $\\$ 19$ to $\\$ 134,973$, a rate of $19.7 \\%$ compounded annually.*\n\nOn the facing page, we show our long-standing performance measurement: The yearly change in Berkshire's per-share book value versus the market performance of the S\\&P 500. What counts, of course, is pershare intrinsic value. But that's a subjective figure, and book value is useful as a rough tracking indicator. (An extended discussion of intrinsic value is included in our Owner-Related Business Principles on pages 103 - 108. Those principles have been included in our reports for 30 years, and we urge new and prospective shareholders to read them.)\n\nAs I've long told you, Berkshire's intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. Moreover, the difference has widened considerably in recent years. That's why our 2012 decision to authorize the repurchase of shares at $120 \\%$ of book value made sense. Purchases at that level benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value exceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount. We did not purchase shares during 2013, however, because the stock price did not descend to the $120 \\%$ level. If it does, we will be aggressive.\n\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and my partner, and I believe both Berkshire's book value and intrinsic value will outperform the S\\&P in years when the market is down or moderately up. We expect to fall short, though, in years when the market is strong - as we did in 2013. We have underperformed in ten of our 49 years, with all but one of our shortfalls occurring when the S\\&P gain exceeded $15 \\%$.\n\nOver the stock market cycle between yearends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S\\&P. Through full cycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay. After all, you could always own an index fund and be assured of S\\&P results.\n\n## The Year at Berkshire\n\nOn the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year - in certain cases very well. Let me count the ways:\n\n- We completed two large acquisitions, spending almost $\\$ 18$ billion to purchase all of NV Energy and a major interest in H. J. Heinz. Both companies fit us well and will be prospering a century from now.\n\nWith the Heinz purchase, moreover, we created a partnership template that may be used by Berkshire in future acquisitions of size. Here, we teamed up with investors at 3G Capital, a firm led by my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann. His talented associates - Bernardo Hees, Heinz's new CEO, and Alex Behring, its Chairman - are responsible for operations.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire's A shares. Figures for the B shares are $1 / 1500^{\\text {th }}$ of those shown for A.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 2, "markdown": "Berkshire is the financing partner. In that role, we purchased $\\$ 8$ billion of Heinz preferred stock that carries a $9 \\%$ coupon but also possesses other features that should increase the preferred's annual return to $12 \\%$ or so. Berkshire and 3G each purchased half of the Heinz common stock for $\\$ 4.25$ billion.\n\nThough the Heinz acquisition has some similarities to a \"private equity\" transaction, there is a crucial difference: Berkshire never intends to sell a share of the company. What we would like, rather, is to buy more, and that could happen: Certain 3G investors may sell some or all of their shares in the future, and we might increase our ownership at such times. Berkshire and 3G could also decide at some point that it would be mutually beneficial if we were to exchange some of our preferred for common shares (at an equity valuation appropriate to the time).\n\nOur partnership took control of Heinz in June, and operating results so far are encouraging. Only minor earnings from Heinz, however, are reflected in those we report for Berkshire this year: One-time charges incurred in the purchase and subsequent restructuring of operations totaled $\\$ 1.3$ billion. Earnings in 2014 will be substantial.\n\nWith Heinz, Berkshire now owns $81 / 2$ companies that, were they stand-alone businesses, would be in the Fortune 500. Only $491 \\frac{1}{2}$ to go.\n\nNV Energy, purchased for $\\$ 5.6$ billion by MidAmerican Energy, our utility subsidiary, supplies electricity to about $88 \\%$ of Nevada's population. This acquisition fits nicely into our existing electric-utility operation and offers many possibilities for large investments in renewable energy. NV Energy will not be MidAmerican's last major acquisition.\n\n- MidAmerican is one of our \"Powerhouse Five\" - a collection of large non-insurance businesses that, in aggregate, had a record $\\$ 10.8$ billion of pre-tax earnings in 2013, up $\\$ 758$ million from 2012. The other companies in this sainted group are BNSF, Iscar, Lubrizol and Marmon.\n\nOf the five, only MidAmerican, then earning $\\$ 393$ million pre-tax, was owned by Berkshire nine years ago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, we paid about $70 \\%$ of the cost in cash, and, for the remainder, issued shares that increased the number outstanding by $6.1 \\%$. In other words, the $\\$ 10.4$ billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire by the five companies over the nine-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simply growing, but rather increasing per-share results.\n\nIf the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2014, we can expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve also - perhaps by $\\$ 1$ billion or so pre-tax.\n\n- Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $\\$ 4.7$ billion pre-tax last year, up from $\\$ 3.9$ billion in 2012. Here, too, we expect further gains in 2014.\n- Berkshire's extensive insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2013 - that makes 11 years in a row - and increased its float. During that 11-year stretch, our float - money that doesn't belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire's benefit - has grown from $\\$ 41$ billion to $\\$ 77$ billion. Concurrently, our underwriting profit has aggregated $\\$ 22$ billion pre-tax, including $\\$ 3$ billion realized in 2013. And all of this all began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $\\$ 8.6$ million.\n\nWe now own a wide variety of exceptional insurance operations. Best known is GEICO, the car insurer Berkshire acquired in full at yearend 1995 (having for many years prior owned a partial interest). GEICO in 1996 ranked number seven among U.S. auto insurers. Now, GEICO is number two, having recently passed Allstate. The reasons for this amazing growth are simple: low prices and reliable service. You can do yourself a favor by calling 1-800-847-7536 or checking Geico.com to see if you, too, can cut your insurance costs.

{"index": 3, "markdown": "- While Charlie and I search for elephants, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions. Last year, we contracted for 25 of these, scheduled to cost $\\$ 3.1$ billion in aggregate. These transactions ranged from $\\$ 1.9$ million to $\\$ 1.1$ billion in size.\n\nCharlie and I encourage these deals. They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. The result is no more work for us and more earnings for you. Many more of these bolt-on deals will be made in future years. In aggregate, they will be meaningful.\n\n- Last year we invested $\\$ 3.5$ billion in the surest sort of bolt-on: the purchase of additional shares in two wonderful businesses that we already controlled. In one case - Marmon - our purchases brought us to the $100 \\%$ ownership we had signed up for in 2008. In the other instance - Iscar - the Wertheimer family elected to exercise a put option it held, selling us the $20 \\%$ of the business it retained when we bought control in 2006.\n\nThese purchases added about $\\$ 300$ million pre-tax to our current earning power and also delivered us $\\$ 800$ million of cash. Meanwhile, the same nonsensical accounting rule that I described in last year's letter required that we enter these purchases on our books at $\\$ 1.8$ billion less than we paid, a process that reduced Berkshire's book value. (The charge was made to \"capital in excess of par value\"; figure that one out.) This weird accounting, you should understand, instantly increased Berkshire's excess of intrinsic value over book value by the same $\\$ 1.8$ billion.\n\n- Our subsidiaries spent a record $\\$ 11$ billion on plant and equipment during 2013, roughly twice our depreciation charge. About $89 \\%$ of that money was spent in the United States. Though we invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunity resides in America.\n- In a year in which most equity managers found it impossible to outperform the S\\&P 500, both Todd Combs and Ted Weschler handily did so. Each now runs a portfolio exceeding $\\$ 7$ billion. They've earned it.\n\nI must again confess that their investments outperformed mine. (Charlie says I should add \"by a lot.\") If such humiliating comparisons continue, I'll have no choice but to cease talking about them.\n\nTodd and Ted have also created significant value for you in several matters unrelated to their portfolio activities. Their contributions are just beginning: Both men have Berkshire blood in their veins.\n\n- Berkshire's yearend employment - counting Heinz - totaled a record 330,745, up 42,283 from last year. The increase, I must admit, included one person at our Omaha home office. (Don't panic: The headquarters gang still fits comfortably on one floor.)\n- Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its \"Big Four\" investments - American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of Wells Fargo (increasing our ownership to $9.2 \\%$ versus $8.7 \\%$ at yearend 2012) and IBM ( $6.3 \\%$ versus $6.0 \\%$ ). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in CocaCola grew from $8.9 \\%$ to $9.1 \\%$ and our interest in American Express from $13.7 \\%$ to $14.2 \\%$. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren't important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our share of their equity raises Berkshire's share of their annual earnings by $\\$ 50$ million.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 4, "markdown": "The four companies possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning $100 \\%$ of a so-so business; it's better to have a partial interest in the Hope diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.\n\nGoing by our yearend holdings, our portion of the \"Big Four's\" 2013 earnings amounted to $\\$ 4.4$ billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive - about $\\$ 1.4$ billion last year. But make no mistake: The $\\$ 3$ billion of their earnings we don't report is every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.\n\nThe earnings that these four companies retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock - a move that enhances our share of future earnings - as well as for funding business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees will grow substantially over time. If they do, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, our unrealized capital gains will, too. (For the four, unrealized gains already totaled $\\$ 39$ billion at yearend.)\n\nOur flexibility in capital allocation - our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses - gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they can operate. Woody Allen stated the general idea when he said: \"The advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.\" Similarly, our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for our endless gusher of cash.\n\nLate in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in Berkshire's history. At the time, I called the transaction an \"all-in wager on the economic future of the United States.\"\n\nThat kind of commitment was nothing new for us: We've been making similar wagers ever since Buffett Partnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too. Charlie and I have always considered a \"bet\" on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.\n\nIndeed, who has ever benefited during the past 237 years by betting against America? If you compare our country's present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. And the dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. America's best days lie ahead.\n\nWith this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value by (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.\n\nThose building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy will still be playing major roles in our economy. Insurance will concomitantly be essential for both businesses and individuals - and no company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire.\n\nMoreover, we will always maintain supreme financial strength, operating with at least $\\$ 20$ billion of cash equivalents and never incurring material amounts of short-term obligations. As we view these and other strengths, Charlie and I like your company's prospects. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 5, "markdown": "# Intrinsic Business Value \n\nAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the three elements - one of them qualitative - that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire's intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 109 - 110.\n\nHere is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2013 our per-share investments increased $13.6 \\%$ to $\\$ 129,253$ and our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased $12.8 \\%$ to $\\$ 9,116$ per share.\n\nSince 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of $19.3 \\%$ compounded annually, and our earnings figure has grown at a $20.6 \\%$ clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the 43 -year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but we will most strongly focus on building operating earnings.\n\nNow, let's examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. So we'll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don't get any ideas!)\n\n## Insurance\n\n\"Our investment in the insurance companies reflects a first major step in our efforts to achieve a more diversified base of earning power.\"\n\u2014 1967 Annual Report\nLet's look first at insurance, Berkshire's core operation and the engine that has consistently propelled our expansion since that 1967 report was published.\n\nProperty-casualty (\"P/C\") insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers' compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collectnow, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums - money we call \"float\" - that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:\n\n| Year | Float (in \\$ millions) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| 1970 | $\\$ 39$ |\n| 1980 | 237 |\n| 1990 | 1,632 |\n| 2000 | 27,871 |\n| 2010 | 65,832 |\n| 2013 | 77,240 |\n\nFurther gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO's float will almost certainly grow. In National Indemnity's reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual - at the outside no more than $3 \\%$ in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. (In this respect, property-casualty insurance differs in an important way from certain forms of life insurance.)", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 6, "markdown": "If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money - and, better yet, get paid for holding it.\n\nUnfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the $\\mathrm{P} / \\mathrm{C}$ industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country's largest insurer and a well-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in nine of the twelve years ending in 2012 (the latest year for which their financials are available, as I write this). Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry - despite the float income all companies enjoy - will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns as compared to other businesses.\n\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eleven consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $\\$ 22$ billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers who know that while float is valuable, it can be drowned by poor underwriting results.\n\nSo how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire's book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims some $\\$ 17$ billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 - and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float. If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability.\n\nA counterpart to this overstated liability is $\\$ 15.5$ billion of \"goodwill\" that is attributable to our insurance companies and included in book value as an asset. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\n\nFortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill - what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation possessing float of similar quality to that we have - to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason - a huge reason - why we believe Berkshire's intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\n\nBerkshire's attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplined operations that possess strong, hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.\n\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $\\$ 250$ billion loss from some megacatastrophe - a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced - Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. And we would remain awash in cash, looking for large opportunities if the catastrophe caused markets to go into shock. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhile be far in the red, with some facing insolvency.\n\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $\\$ 37$ billion and a large cumulative underwriting profit, a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. Ajit's mind is an idea factory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 7, "markdown": "One venture materialized last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\"BHSI\"). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly accepted by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. These professionals recognize that no other insurer can match the financial strength of Berkshire, which guarantees that legitimate claims arising many years in the future will be paid promptly and fully.\n\nBHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance world. Peter has assembled a spectacular team that is already writing a substantial amount of business with many Fortune 500 companies and with smaller operations as well. BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generate volume in the billions within a few years. Give Peter a Berkshire greeting when you see him at the annual meeting.\n\nWe have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can't be obtained.\n\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can't turn their back on business that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, \"The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,\" spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.\n\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re's huge float has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re's international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.\n\nIt can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, the company was beset by problems that caused commentators - and me as well, briefly - to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re is now a gem.\n\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 63 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 52 years of service in 2013. Tony became CEO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying.\n\nWhen I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. That operational efficiency continues today and is an all-important asset. No one likes to buy auto insurance. But almost everyone likes to drive. The insurance needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them - and only a low-cost operation can deliver these.\n\nGEICO's cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year. Its low costs create a moat - an enduring one - that competitors are unable to cross. Meanwhile, our little gecko continues to tell Americans how GEICO can save them important money. With our latest reduction in operating costs, his story has become even more compelling.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 8, "markdown": "In 1995, we purchased the half of GEICO that we didn't already own, paying $\\$ 1.4$ billion more than the net tangible assets we acquired. That's \"goodwill,\" and it will forever remain unchanged on our books. As GEICO's business grows, however, so does its true economic goodwill. I believe that figure to be approaching $\\$ 20$ billion.\n\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation that consistently delivers an underwriting profit. Moreover, as the table below shows, they also provide us with substantial float. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.\n\n|  | Underwriting Profit |  | Yearend Float |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Insurance Operations | (in millions) |  |  |  |\n|  | 2013 | 2012 | 2013 | 2012 |\n| BH Reinsurance | \\$1,294 | \\$ 304 | \\$37,231 | \\$34,821 |\n| General Re | 283 | 355 | 20,013 | 20,128 |\n| GEICO | 1,127 | 680 | 12,566 | 11,578 |\n| Other Primary | 385 | 286 | 7,430 | 6,598 |\n|  | \\$3,089 | \\$1,625 | \\$77,240 | \\$73,125 |\n\nSimply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The \"customer\" pays money now; the insurer promises to pay money in the future if certain events occur.\n\nSometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by those in their 20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay - even if economic chaos prevails when payment time arrives - is all-important.\n\nBerkshire's promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by the actions of the world's largest and most sophisticated insurers, some of which have wanted to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally longlived liabilities, particularly those involving asbestos claims. That is, these insurers wished to \"cede\" their liabilities to a reinsurer. Choosing the wrong reinsurer, however - one that down the road proved to be financially strapped or a bad actor - would put the original insurer in danger of getting the liabilities right back in its lap.\n\nAlmost without exception, the largest insurers seeking aid came to Berkshire. Indeed, in the largest such transaction ever recorded, Lloyd's in 2007 turned over to us both many thousands of known claims arising from policies written before 1993 and an unknown but huge number of claims from that same period sure to materialize in the future. (Yes, we will be receiving claims decades from now that apply to events taking place prior to 1993.)\n\nBerkshire's ultimate payments arising from the Lloyd's transaction are today unknowable. What is certain, however, is that Berkshire will pay all valid claims up to the $\\$ 15$ billion limit of our policy. No other insurer's promise would have given Lloyd's the comfort provided by its agreement with Berkshire. The CEO of the entity then handling Lloyd's claims said it best: \"Names [the original insurers at Lloyd's] wanted to sleep easy at night, and we think we've just bought them the world's best mattress.\"\n\nBerkshire's great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models possessing wide moats form something unique in the insurance world. The combination is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 9, "markdown": "\"Though there are many regulatory restraints in the utility industry, it's possible that we will make additional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts involved could be large. \"\n\n- 1999 Annual Report\n\nWe have two major operations, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.\n\nA key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF's interest coverage was 9:1. (Our definition of coverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as seriously flawed.)\n\nAt MidAmerican, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company's ability to service its debt under all circumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies exclusively offering an essential service. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earnings streams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Now, with the acquisition of NV Energy, MidAmerican's earnings base has further broadened. This particular strength, supplemented by Berkshire's ownership, has enabled MidAmerican and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This advantage benefits both us and our customers.\n\nEvery day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:\n\n- BNSF carries about $15 \\%$ (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact establishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy's circulatory system. Its hold on the number-one position strengthened in 2013.\n\nBNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on the same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.\n\n- MidAmerican's utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. In addition, we are the leader in renewables: From a standing start nine years ago, MidAmerican now accounts for $7 \\%$ of the country's wind generation capacity, with more on the way. Our share in solar - most of which is still in construction - is even larger.\n\nMidAmerican can make these investments because it retains all of its earnings. Here's a little known fact: Last year MidAmerican retained more dollars of earnings - by far - than any other American electric utility. We and our regulators see this as an important advantage - one almost certain to exist five, ten and twenty years from now.\n\nWhen our current projects are completed, MidAmerican's renewables portfolio will have cost $\\$ 15$ billion. We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns. And, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 10, "markdown": "Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providers in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is meanwhile in our selfinterest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.\n\nTangible proof of our dedication to that duty was delivered last year in a poll of customer satisfaction covering 52 holding companies and their 101 operating electric utilities. Our MidAmerican group ranked number one, with $95.3 \\%$ of respondents giving us a \"very satisfied\" vote and not a single customer rating us \"dissatisfied.\" The bottom score in the survey, incidentally, was a dismal $34.5 \\%$.\n\nAll three of our companies were ranked far lower by this measure before they were acquired by MidAmerican. The extraordinary customer satisfaction we have achieved is of great importance as we expand: Regulators in states we hope to enter are glad to see us, knowing we will be responsible operators.\n\nOur railroad has been diligent as well in anticipating the needs of its customers. Whatever you may have heard about our country's crumbling infrastructure in no way applies to BNSF or railroads generally. America's rail system has never been in better shape, a consequence of huge investments by the industry. We are not, however, resting: BNSF spent $\\$ 4$ billion on the railroad in 2013, double its depreciation charge and a single-year record for any railroad. And, we will spend considerably more in 2014. Like Noah, who foresaw early on the need for dependable transportation, we know it's our job to plan ahead.\n\nLeading our two capital-intensive companies are Greg Abel, at MidAmerican, and the team of Matt Rose and Carl Ice at BNSF.

In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 12, "markdown": "I won't explain all of the adjustments - some are tiny and arcane - but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others in no way lose value. With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arise through purchase-accounting rules and are clearly not real costs. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated - even though from an investor's viewpoint they could not be more different.\n\nIn the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 29, amortization charges of $\\$ 648$ million for the companies included in this section are deducted as expenses. We would call about $20 \\%$ of these \"real,\" the rest not. This difference has become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. It will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.\n\nEventually, of course, the non-real charges disappear when the assets to which they're related become fully amortized. But this usually takes 15 years and - alas - it will be my successor whose reported earnings get the benefit of their expiration.\n\nEvery dime of depreciation expense we report, however, is a real cost. And that's true at almost all other companies as well. When Wall Streeters tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, button your wallet.\n\nOur public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however, remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.\n\nThe crowd of companies in this section sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of these businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from $25 \\%$ after-tax to far more than $100 \\%$. Others generate good returns in the area of $12 \\%$ to $20 \\%$. A few, however, have very poor returns, a result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operated.\n\nFortunately, my blunders usually involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally worked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, however, made my last mistake in purchasing either businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.\n\nViewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average of $\\$ 25$ billion of net tangible assets during 2013 and, with large quantities of excess cash and little leverage, earned $16.7 \\%$ after-tax on that capital.\n\nOf course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the purchase price is excessive. We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a good margin. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in the insurance and regulated-industry segments is far greater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.\n\nWe have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, both current and potential competitors read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if they knew our numbers. So, in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required.

I'm not covering this event because of its economic importance to Berkshire - it takes more than a new store to move the needle on Berkshire's $\\$ 225$ billion equity base. But I've now worked 30 years with the marvelous Blumkin family, and I'm excited about the remarkable store - truly Texas-sized - it is building at The Colony, in the northern part of the Dallas metropolitan area.\n\nWhen the store is completed next year, NFM will have - under one roof, and on a 433-acre site -1.8 million square feet of retail and supporting warehouse space. View the project's progress at www.nfm.com/texas.

I predict the Texas store will blow these records away. If you live anywhere near Dallas, come check us out.\n\nI think back to August 30, 1983 - my birthday - when I went to see Mrs. B (Rose Blumkin), carrying a $11 / 4$-page purchase proposal for NFM that I had drafted. (It's reproduced on pages 114 - 115.) Mrs. B accepted my offer without changing a word, and we completed the deal without the involvement of investment bankers or lawyers (an experience that can only be described as heavenly). Though the company's financial statements were unaudited, I had no worries. Mrs. B simply told me what was what, and her word was good enough for me.\n\nMrs. B was 89 at the time and worked until 103 - definitely my kind of woman. Take a look at NFM's financial statements from 1946 on pages 116 - 117. Everything NFM now owns comes from (a) that $\\$ 72,264$ of net worth and $\\$ 50$ - no zeros omitted - of cash the company then possessed, and (b) the incredible talents of Mrs. B, her son, Louie, and his sons Ron and Irv.\n\nThe punch line to this story is that Mrs. B never spent a day in school. Moreover, she emigrated from Russia to America knowing not a word of English. But she loved her adopted country: At Mrs. B's request, the family always sang God Bless America at its gatherings.\n\nAspiring business managers should look hard at the plain, but rare, attributes that produced Mrs. B's incredible success. Students from 40 universities visit me every year, and I have them start the day with a visit to NFM. If they absorb Mrs. B's lessons, they need none from me.\n\n# Finance and Financial Products \n\n\"Clayton's loan portfolio will likely grow to at least $\\$ 5$ billion in not too many years and, with sensible credit standards in place, should deliver significant earnings.\"\n\n- 2003 Annual Report\n\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), as well as Clayton Homes, the country's leading producer and financer of manufactured homes.

Usually, we've done well in these. But not always.\n\nMost of you have never heard of Energy Future Holdings. Consider yourselves lucky; I certainly wish I hadn't.

Though there are no guarantees, we expect a similar result from those remaining on our books.\n\n# Some Thoughts About Investing \n\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.\n\n- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham\n\nIt is fitting to have a Ben Graham quote open this discussion because I owe so much of what I know about investing to him. I will talk more about Ben a bit later, and I will even sooner talk about common stocks. But let me first tell you about two small non-stock investments that I made long ago. Though neither changed my net worth by much, they are instructive.\n\nThis tale begins in Nebraska. From 1973 to 1981, the Midwest experienced an explosion in farm prices, caused by a widespread belief that runaway inflation was coming and fueled by the lending policies of small rural banks. Then the bubble burst, bringing price declines of $50 \\%$ or more that devastated both leveraged farmers and their lenders. Five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed in that bubble's aftermath than in our recent Great Recession.\n\nIn 1986, I purchased a 400 -acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me $\\$ 280,000$, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothing about operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming and I learned from him both how many bushels of corn and soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, I calculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about $10 \\%$. I also thought it was likely that productivity would improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.\n\nI needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and potentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop and prices would sometimes disappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under any pressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or more what I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 16, "markdown": "In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon's landlord when I was the company's CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to NYU that the Resolution Trust Corp. was selling. Again, a bubble had popped - this one involving commercial real estate - and the RTC had been created to dispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.\n\nHere, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield from the property was about $10 \\%$. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increase when several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant - who occupied around $20 \\%$ of the project's space - was paying rent of about $\\$ 5$ per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $\\$ 70$. The expiration of this bargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property's location was also superb: NYU wasn't going anywhere.\n\nI joined a small group, including Larry and my friend Fred Rose, that purchased the parcel. Fred was an experienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it they did. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed $35 \\%$ of our original equity investment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several special distributions totaling more than $150 \\%$ of what we had invested. I've yet to view the property.\n\nIncome from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in the decades to come. Though the gains won't be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.\n\nI tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:\n\n- You don't need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren't, you must recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don't swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick \"no.\"\n- Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don't feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset's future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every investment possibility. But omniscience isn't necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.\n- If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their first toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.\n- With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field - not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stock prices, give it a try on weekdays.\n- Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hear TV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle's scathing comment: \"You don't know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.\")", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 17, "markdown": "- My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market might do in the years immediately following - 1987 and 1994 - was of no importance to me in making those investments. I can't remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever the chatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.\n\nThere is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farm or the New York real estate.\n\nIt should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings - and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his - and those prices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state - how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\n\nOwners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits - and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their comments.\n\nThose people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often become frenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an implied message of \"Don't just sit there, do something.\" For these investors, liquidity is transformed from the unqualified benefit it should be to a curse.\n\nA \"flash crash\" or some other extreme market fluctuation can't hurt an investor any more than an erratic and mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.\n\nDuring the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling my farm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned $100 \\%$ of a solid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. So why would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of them might eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth was going to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?\n\nWhen Charlie and I buy stocks - which we think of as small portions of businesses - our analysis is very similar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out, or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at a reasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimate future earnings - which is usually the case - we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have worked together, we have never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views of other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.\n\nIt's vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our \"circle of competence\" and stay well inside of it. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters that occur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and a desire to be where the action is.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 18, "markdown": "Most investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise, they will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.\n\nI have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn't need this skill. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts). In the $20^{\\text {th }}$ Century, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497, paying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The $21^{\\text {st }}$ Century will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners - neither he nor his \"helpers\" can do that - but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost S\\&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.\n\nThat's the \"what\" of investing for the non-professional. The \"when\" is also important. The main danger is that the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become disillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs' observation: \"A bull market is like sex. It feels best just before it ends.\") The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over a long period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the \"know-nothing\" investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better longterm results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.\n\nIf \"investors\" frenetically bought and sold farmland to each other, neither the yields nor prices of their crops would be increased. The only consequence of such behavior would be decreases in the overall earnings realized by the farm-owning population because of the substantial costs it would incur as it sought advice and switched properties.\n\nNevertheless, both individuals and institutions will constantly be urged to be active by those who profit from giving advice or effecting transactions. The resulting frictional costs can be huge and, for investors in aggregate, devoid of benefit. So ignore the chatter, keep your costs minimal, and invest in stocks as you would in a farm.\n\nMy money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I've laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife's benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put $10 \\%$ of the cash in short-term government bonds and $90 \\%$ in a very low-cost S\\&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.) I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors - whether pension funds, institutions or individuals - who employ high-fee managers.\n\nAnd now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben's book The Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase.\n\nBefore reading Ben's book, I had wandered around the investing landscape, devouring everything written on the subject. Much of what I read fascinated me: I tried my hand at charting and at using market indicia to predict stock movements. I sat in brokerage offices watching the tape roll by, and I listened to commentators. All of this was fun, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't getting anywhere.\n\nIn contrast, Ben's ideas were explained logically in elegant, easy-to-understand prose (without Greek letters or complicated formulas). For me, the key points were laid out in what later editions labeled Chapters 8 and 20. (The original 1949 edition numbered its chapters differently.) These points guide my investing decisions today.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 19, "markdown": "A couple of interesting sidelights about the book: Later editions included a postscript describing an unnamed investment that was a bonanza for Ben. Ben made the purchase in 1948 when he was writing the first edition and - brace yourself - the mystery company was GEICO. If Ben had not recognized the special qualities of GEICO when it was still in its infancy, my future and Berkshire's would have been far different.\n\nThe 1949 edition of the book also recommended a railroad stock that was then selling for $\\$ 17$ and earning about $\\$ 10$ per share. (One of the reasons I admired Ben was that he had the guts to use current examples, leaving himself open to sneers if he stumbled.) In part, that low valuation resulted from an accounting rule of the time that required the railroad to exclude from its reported earnings the substantial retained earnings of affiliates.\n\nThe recommended stock was Northern Pacific, and its most important affiliate was Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. These railroads are now important parts of BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), which is today fully owned by Berkshire. When I read the book, Northern Pacific had a market value of about $\\$ 40$ million. Now its successor (having added a great many properties, to be sure) earns that amount every four days.\n\nI can't remember what I paid for that first copy of The Intelligent Investor. Whatever the cost, it would underscore the truth of Ben's adage: Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Of all the investments I ever made, buying Ben's book was the best (except for my purchase of two marriage licenses).\n\nLocal and state financial problems are accelerating, in large part because public entities promised pensions they couldn't afford. Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them. Unfortunately, pension mathematics today remain a mystery to most Americans.\n\nInvestment policies, as well, play an important role in these problems. In 1975, I wrote a memo to Katharine Graham, then chairman of The Washington Post Company, about the pitfalls of pension promises and the importance of investment policy. That memo is reproduced on pages 118 - 136.\n\nDuring the next decade, you will read a lot of news - bad news - about public pension plans. I hope my memo is helpful to you in understanding the necessity for prompt remedial action where problems exist.\n\n# The Annual Meeting \n\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May $3^{\\text {rd }}$ at the CenturyLink Center. Carrie Sova, our talented ringmaster, will be in charge, and all of our headquarters group will pitch in to help her. Our gang both does a better job than professional event planners would and - yes - saves us money.\n\nCenturyLink's doors will open at 7 a.m., and at 7:30 we will have our third International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target will be a Clayton Home porch, precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. I tossed about 500,000 papers when I was a teenager, so I think I'm pretty good. Challenge me: I'll buy a Dilly Bar for anyone who lands his or her throw closer to the doorstep than I do. The papers will be 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).\n\nAt 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink's stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day's question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 20, "markdown": "The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We'll assist you by filling the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,062 pairs of Justin boots (that's a pair every 32 seconds), 12,792 pounds of See's candy, 11,162 Quikut knives ( 21 knives per minute) and 6,344 pairs of Wells Lamont gloves, always a hot item. This year, Charlie and I will have competing ketchup bottles for sale. Naturally, the one with Charlie's picture will be heavily discounted. But, if you help, my bottle will outsell his. This is important, so don't let me down.\n\nBrooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our second annual \"Berkshire 5K,\" an 8 a.m. race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor's Guide that you will receive with your tickets for the meeting. Entrants will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire's managers, directors and associates.\n\nGEICO will have a booth in the shopping area, staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8\\%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least half of you, I believe we can.\n\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles. One is Max Olson's compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965. The book includes an index that I find particularly useful, specifying page numbers for individuals, companies and subject matter. I also recommend Forty Chances by my son, Howard. You'll enjoy it.\n\nIf you are a big spender - or aspire to become one - visit Signature Flight Support on the east side of the Omaha airport between noon and 5 p.m. on Saturday. There, we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft sure to set your pulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. Live a little.\n\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about $21 / 2$ hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us.\n\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on $72^{\\text {nd }}$ Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having \"Berkshire Weekend\" discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the store did $\\$ 40.2$ million of business, breaking its previous record by $12 \\%$. It also set a single day record of $\\$ 8.2$ million on Saturday, selling nearly $\\$ 1$ million of mattresses alone.\n\nTo obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 29th and Monday, May $5^{\\text {th }}$ inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period's special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.\n\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May $2^{\\text {nd }}$. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May $4^{\\text {th }}$, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded sales in all of December, normally a jeweler's best month.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 21, "markdown": "About 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, I will begin clerking at Borsheims. Ask for my \"Crazy Warren\" quote on the item of your choice. As I get older, my pricing gets ever more ridiculous. Come take advantage of me.\n\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April $28^{\\text {th }}$ through Saturday, May $10^{\\text {th }}$. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder.\n\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers - who will have their eyes wide open - in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world's top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don't play them for money.\n\nMy friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. Last year, she made Americans - and especially me - proud with her performance at the Olympics.\n\nI met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she's a freshman at Princeton and the U.S. Women's Champion. If you don't mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.\n\nGorat's and Piccolo's will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 4th. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat's opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo's opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants are my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat's, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and for Piccolo's call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo's order a giant root beer float for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.\n\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.\n\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected.)\n\nWe will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will be Jay Gelb of Barclays. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff \\& Goldfarb.\n\nAnd we will again have a credentialed bear on Berkshire. We would like to hear from applicants who are short Berkshire (please include evidence of your position). The three analysts will bring their own Berkshirespecific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience in asking them.\n\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That's why we try to issue financial information late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is held on Saturdays. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts, but rather treat all shareholders the same. Our hope is that the journalists and analysts will ask questions that further educate our owners about their investment.", "images": [], "dimensions": {"dpi": 200, "height": 2200, "width": 1700}}
{"index": 22, "markdown": "Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalists and analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that's the way we like it. All told, we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is some extra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 15 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room.\n\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly AllStars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no financial need to work; the joy of hitting business \"home runs\" means as much to them as their paycheck.\n\nEqually important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 23,000-page Federal income tax return as well as state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country's largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board's activities - and the list goes on and on.\n\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy and pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q\\&A day with me. They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and French fries (smothered in ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.\n\nIn closing, I think it's become appropriate to ignore our \"no pictures\" policy and let you view our remarkable home-office crew. Below is a photo from our Christmas lunch. Two people couldn't make it; otherwise you are looking at all of those who staff Berkshire's headquarters. They are truly miracle-workers.\n\nNext year's letter will review our 50 years at Berkshire and speculate a bit about the next 50. In the meantime, come to Omaha on May $3^{\\text {rd }}$ and enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.\n\nFebruary 28, 2014\nWarren E.
